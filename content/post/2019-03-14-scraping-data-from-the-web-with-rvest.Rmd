Although there are lots of R packages that offer special purpose data-download tools---Eric Persson's [`gesis`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gesis/vignettes/gesis.html) is one of my favorites, and I'm fond of [`icpsrdata`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/icpsrdata/vignettes/icpsrdata-vignette.html) and [`ropercenter`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ropercenter/vignettes/ropercenter-vignette.html) too---but the Swiss Army knife of webscraping is the `rvest` package.  That is to say, if there's a specialized tool for the data you're after, you're much better off using _that_ tool, but if not, then `rvest` will help you to get the job done. 

In this post, I'll explain how to do two common webscraping tasks using `rvest`: scraping tables from the web straight into R and scraping the links to a bunch of files so you can then do a batch download.
