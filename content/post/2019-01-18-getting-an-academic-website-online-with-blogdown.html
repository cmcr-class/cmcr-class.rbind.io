<h2>Building Your Academic Website With blogdown</h2>
<p>Okay, you’ve gotten <a href="https://happygitwithr.com">RStudio installed and linked up with GitHub</a>. You’ve gotten started with RMarkdown, and you’re <a href="/blog/rmarkdown-everywhere">ready to use it to write all of your academic documents</a> so your work will be reproducible. The next step is to get an academic website to display your work online. Conveniently, we can use RStudio, GitHub, and RMarkdown to do that, too! First, we need to build the site:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We start by creating a new project repo on GitHub and opening it in RStudio (<a href="https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html">you remember how to do that, right?</a>). Call it whatever you like.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/post/2019-01-18-getting-an-academic-website-online-with-blogdown_files/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-21%20at%207.26.04%20AM.png" width="600" /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The R package we need for this task is called <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>, which is built on top of <a href="https://gohugo.io">a framework for building websites called Hugo</a>. Install them both by typing this into the console, in the bottom left pane of RStudio:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)    # install the blogdown package
blogdown::install_hugo()        # install Hugo (a function in the blogdown package)</code></pre>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now, in the lower right pane of RStudio, you’ll see the Files tab; as advertised, it provides an alternate way of browsing through your files. The first file listed in your new repo should be called .gitignore. More truth in advertising: this file is where you list documents for this project that you don’t want to save in the project’s git (and, in turn, GitHub) repo. Open it up and paste in the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
blogdown/
public/</code></pre>
<p>The first four lines are already there, the fifth and sixth are irrelevant system files on Macs and Windows machines respectively, and the last two are directories (that is, folders) <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/version-control.html">that blogdown uses that we don’t need backed up</a>.</p>

<h2>Publishing Your Website Using Netlify</h2>
<p>Once you have your website looking good on your own machine, you’re ready to get it online.</p>
</div>
<div id="changing-the-domain-name" class="section level2">
<h2>Changing the Domain Name</h2>
<p>By default, Netlify will provide your website with some random address (for cmcr-class, I got boring-mayer-5d40c1.netlify.com). There are a number of ways to get a more presentable address. The quickest and easiest way is to simply rename the site on Netlify: if you’re not still there, log into Netlify and choose your site, then click on Settings. Under “Site details,” you’ll see “Site information” (the first bit of which will be the “Site name,” which in turn should still display that random address Netlify assigned you). At the bottom of “Site details” is a button labelled “Change site name.” Clicking there will let you choose a different subdomain, that is, all the stuff before .netlify.com. As long as no one’s beat you to it, you can have pretty much any name you want.</p>

</div>
<p>Your next step up in customization—requiring only a bit more effort and no more expense—is to get a free rbind.io subdomain from RStudio. Submit <a href="https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/new">the request form</a> (cleverly disguised as a GitHub issue) and wait for one of the extremely good-hearted volunteers who provide this service to get back to you. For me, this only took about an hour, if that even, but if it takes longer, please be patient. Follow the directions in their response (#1) to reconfigure Netlify to use your new custom rbind domain. When you do this, Netlify will warn you that rbind.io is owned by someone else or some such. Don’t panic. You knew that already; you’re not stealing it. Just click through. It’ll be fine.</p>

</div>
<p>Yep, I got the “Check DNS configuration” hint from Netlify after adding the rbind subdomain (#2). And, yep, I ignored it. Easy. Here’s the tl;dr on #3: create a plain text document in the project directory for your website called <code>_redirects</code> with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>http://cmcr-class.rbind.io/*    https://cmcr-class.rbind.io/:splat  301!
https://cmcr-class.netlify.com/*  https://cmcr-class.rbind.io/:splat  301!</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to swap out <code>cmcr-class</code> for whatever you named your subdomain, of course. The first line redirects any nonsecure HTTP links to your site to secure HTTPS links. The second ensures that anyone who happens to try to visit your site via netlify.io gets redirected to your preferred rbind.io address so that all of your visitors will have the same address for any given page. And then you’re done.</p>
<p>The last choice, if an rbind.io subdomain isn’t custom enough for you, if you just <em>need</em> the ultimate in domain name customization, you can (wait for it) buy a custom domain name. Custom domains are generally pretty cheap, up to maybe $10 a year, and they require a bit more configuring, but don’t let that scare you off: as long as you choose your domain reasonably carefully, you’re only going to have to do this work once. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/">Directions from Netlify are here</a>, and the company you buy the domain from will likely have directions for you too.</p>
