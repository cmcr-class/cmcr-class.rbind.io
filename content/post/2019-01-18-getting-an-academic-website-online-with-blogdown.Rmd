## Changing the Domain Name

By default, Netlify will provide your website with some random address (for cmcr-class, I got boring-mayer-5d40c1.netlify.com).  There are a number of ways to get a more presentable address.  The quickest and easiest way is to simply rename the site on Netlify: if you're not still there, log into Netlify and choose your site, then click on Settings.  Under "Site details," you'll see "Site information" (the first bit of which will be the "Site name," which in turn should still display that random address Netlify assigned you). At the bottom of "Site details" is a button labelled "Change site name."  Clicking there will let you choose a different subdomain, that is, all the stuff before .netlify.com.  As long as no one's beat you to it, you can have pretty much any name you want.

Your next step up in customization---requiring only a bit more effort and no more expense---is to get a free rbind.io subdomain from RStudio.  Submit [the request form](https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/new) (cleverly disguised as a GitHub issue) and wait for one of the extremely good-hearted volunteers who provide this service to get back to you.  For me, this only took about an hour, if that even, but if it takes longer, please be patient.  Follow the directions in their response to reconfigure Netlify to point your new address.
