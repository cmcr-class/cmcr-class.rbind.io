## Changing the Domain Name

By default, Netlify will provide your website with some random address (for cmcr-class, I got boring-mayer-5d40c1.netlify.com).  There are a number of ways to get a more presentable address.  The quickest and easiest way is to simply rename the site on Netlify: if you're not still there, log into Netlify and choose your site, then click on Settings.  Under "Site details," you'll see "Site information" (the first bit of which will be the "Site name," which in turn should still display that random address Netlify assigned you). At the bottom of "Site details" is a button labelled "Change site name."  Clicking there will let you choose a different subdomain, that is, all the stuff before .netlify.com.  As long as no one's beat you to it, you can have pretty much any name you want.
